      <h2>☄️Outer Citizen</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on June 16, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
I’ve never really felt like I belonged to just one place. Born in Venezuela, raised in the United States, now navigating life in Mexico — I’ve met people, lost people, gained languages, and even regained lost ones (lol). I carry stories across borders and time zones, a patchwork of every version of me I’ve been.
<br>
Being an Outer Citizen isn’t about distance — it’s about perspective. I’ve always existed between worlds: cultures, careers, even dimensions. But through it all, I’ve come to realize that we are all connected — not by borders or systems, but by energy, experience, and existence itself.
<br>
Maybe we’re all Outer Citizens in some way, orbiting the same truth: that we belong not just somewhere… but everywhere.        
 <br>       
..Regardless of "immigration status" 😘
